astrolyze Documentation
=======================

Astrolyze is a python-package with several functions for reduction and analysis
of (mainly) radioastronomical data. It is developed over the course of my
Diploma and PhD thesis and beyond. I share this package here because I
think that it may be useful to other astronomers. The package is open for
collaboration.

Please read the :ref:`label_motivation` section first if you are new to the package.

.. warning::

   AstroLyze is functional but not stable. It is provided on a best-effort base
   momentarily.
