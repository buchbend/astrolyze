astrolyze Documentation
=======================

Astrolyze is a python-package with several functions for reduction and analysis
of (mainly) radioastronomical data analysis. It is developed over the course of 
my Diploma and PhD thesis. I decided to package the functions because I think
that they may be useful to other astronomers. The package is open for 
collaboration.
