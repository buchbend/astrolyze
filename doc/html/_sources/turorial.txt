Astrolyze Tutorial
******************

This tutorial explains how to work with the mapclass module to easily analyze
and modify astronomical images.

Before we dive into details here are some examples of AstroLyze's capabilities.

Say you have a number of maps of a galaxy at different wavelengths covering the
dust sed and you want to smooth them all to the same resolution. They are all
stored under one folder (with possible subfolders) and follow the "Naming
Convention" I introduce below. Using MapClass and MapTools this task could be
done as follows

>>> from astrolyze.mapclass import * 
>>> from astrolyze.maptools import *
>>> map_list = maptools.get_list(folder_with_maps)
>>> final_resolution = 40
>>> folder_to_store_maps = '../anyfolder'
>>> maptools.unify_resolution(map_list, final_resolution, folder, 
>>>                           folder_to_store_maps)
